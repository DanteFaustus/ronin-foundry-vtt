# How to use this module

This module requires the use of the Mörk Borg game sysyem located here: https://github.com/fvtt-fria-ligan/morkborg-foundry-vtt/tree/main. (also available on from within Foundry interface)

Therefore please follow all instructions located here: https://github.com/fvtt-fria-ligan/morkborg-foundry-vtt/blob/main/how-to-use-this-system.md for character creation, combat, creatures, inventory, etcetera. 

Please note: Ronin uses different terminology (and sometimes rules usage) for money, abilities, powers, and some other aspects of the game and rules.
- You may need to find your own processes to conduct combat actions not contained in the main (Mörk Borg) system. However Parry is included as a feat. 
- The following terms in Rōnin utilize the data fields in parenthesis in the main (Mörk Borg) system.
  - Swiftness (Agility)
  - Spirit (Presence)
  - Vigor (Strength)
  - Resilience (Toughness)
  - Texts (Powers/Scrolls)
  - Ryo (Silver)
- The Black Calendar in Rōnin is different than the calendar in Mörk Borg. A journal entry is included for you to track or note differences and game impacts.
- Known Issues: when "getting better" (or leveling up) the core Mörk Borg rules and the Foundry implementation there is a feature where you roll for a found item or silver.  Rōnin does not have this rule. To address this issue do one of the following:
1) Manually remove the silver added to your character sheet.
2) Conduct level ups through all manual roles as opposed to using the "Get Better" button.
