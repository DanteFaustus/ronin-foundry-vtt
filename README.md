Current known issues or needing to be completed tasks:
1) When you “get better or “level up” it will add silver (ryo)to a character. This either has to be taken off manually or simply level 2) up with manual dice rolls as opposed to the “get better button”
3) Texts needs to be added,
3) Class features for all classes but for Forgotten Ronin need to be added.
4) There may be more roll tables that need to be added.
5) Only a few monsters have been added. Simply create any others you need manually. 
6) Honor “cheat sheets” need to be added
